This repo contains code for SeaExam, a toolkit for evaluating large language models (LLM) for Southeast Asian (SEA) languages including Chinese, English, Indonesian, Thai, and Vietnamese.

The evaluation dataset consists of [M3Exam](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/M3Exam) and translated [MMLU](https://github.com/hendrycks/test) datsets. For more information, refer to the huggingface [dataset page](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SeaLLMs/SeaExam).

Please also check SeaBench dataset [here](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/SeaBench) for more evaluation tasks on SEA languages.

## Setup enironment
```
git clone https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/SeaExam.git
cd SeaExam
conda create -n SeaExam python=3.9
conda activate SeaExam
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

## Evaluate models

To quickly evaluate your model on SeaExam, just run 
```
python scripts/main.py --model $model_name_or_path
```

For example: 
```
python scripts/main.py --model SeaLLMs/SeaLLMs-v3-7B-Chat
```
Or 
```
bash quick_run.sh
```

## Under the hood

Our goal is to ensure a fair and consistent comparison across different LLMs while mitigating the risk of data contamination. 

To ensure a fair comparison and reduce LLMs' dependence on specific prompt templates, we have designed several templates. If `dynamic_template` is set as True (which is the default setting), a template will be randomly selected for each question. Additionally, users have the option to change the seed value to generate a different set of questions for evaluation purposes.
